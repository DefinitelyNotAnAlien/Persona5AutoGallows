# Persona5AutoGallows

("What are you waiting for?")
Sometimes I'm just that lazy...
A small script to automate the min-max process for the Gallows in Persona 5 by detecting the stats that will level up and repeating the selection process until the desired stats are highlighted.

Currently only works for the RPCS3 on Windows.
