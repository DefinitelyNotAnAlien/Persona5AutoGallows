# Persona5AutoGallows
Cause sometimes I'm just that lazy... ("What are you waiting for?")

A small script to automate the min-max process for the Gallows in Persona 5 by detecting the stats that will level up and repeating the selection process until the desired stats are highlighted. Currently only works for the RPCS3.
